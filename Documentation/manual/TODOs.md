#First TODOs
1. Get a license for Adobe products from the IT Helpdesk. There is a page on the [myfhs](https://myfhs.fh-salzburg.ac.at/display/ITHDESK/Adobe+Creative+Cloud+-+HowTo) about how to do this. You will have to create image markers in Photoshop or Marie (Project Partner at PH) will occasionaly ask you to download Adobe Stock photos for her. 

2. Get an Apple Account (Apple Id) and ask Hilmar to add you to the Multimedia Technology Organization. You might need extra permission to access "Cloud managed build certificates" to easily upload your builds.

3. Get a new Unity Account or use your existing account. Make Markus add you to the Multimedia Technology Organization. (If he makes you an owner you can assign seats and assets yourself)

4.  Assign a seat for Unity Pro and the assets to your account
	* 3D Web View by Vuplex (3 assets per OS)
	* AR Foundation Editor Remote  
	* Farm Animal Sounds
	* Polygon Icons Pack - Low Poly 3D Art by Synty
	* Cow family
	* Simple Farm Animals
	* Polygon Farm - Low Poly 3D Art by Synty

5. Get familiar with the project by taking a look at code and the Unity projeect

6. Your first task will probably be to continue implementing the Realistic Cow mini game. For more about mini games in general and the Realistic Cow mini game see the chapter [MiniGame](MiniGame.md). You will probably need the [InteractionSystem](InteractionSystem.md) as well.
